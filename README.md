# This is a template data science project

## Setup
### Clone
To load the template on to your machine without git. Go to the directory you would
like the project to be in.
```bash
gh repo clone ogiles1999/example-project-template && cd example-project-template && rm -rf .git && tree -a
```
This clones the repo, deletes the .git folder and executes tree so you can see the
structure of the files in the repo.

### TDD (Optional)
If you are not interested in using TDD (test driven development during the project)
execute this command as well otherwise move onto data collection.
```bash
rm -rf .github && rm -rf tests
```
